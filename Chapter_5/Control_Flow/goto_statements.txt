1. Goto Statements
    --> consists of goto command and a label
    --> must have function scope
        --> goto statement and label must be in the same function
    
    --> e.g.
    int main() {
        std::cout << "abc\n";
        goto next;
        std::cout << "this statement was skipped";
    next:
        std::cout << "here I am\n"; 
    }

2. Why They are Bad
    --> makes the logic of your code hard to follow
    --> can arbitrarily jump around
    --> can use better constructs to implement the same thing
