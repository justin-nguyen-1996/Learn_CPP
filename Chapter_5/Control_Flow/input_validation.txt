1. Four Main Input Errors
    --> Meaningless Input (expecting a,b,c but received d)
        (program doesn't handle this case)
    --> Extra Input (expecting one character, but received two chars)
    --> Numerical Value Overflowed (gave a number too large or small)
    --> Mismatched Data (expecting an int, but given a string)
    
2. Clearing the Input Buffer
    --> std::cin
    --> input is stored into a buffer and extracted with << operator
    --> anything not extraced remains in the buffer
        (which can cause problems)
    --> clear the buffer using std::cin.ignore
        std::cin.ignore(32767, '\n')
        --> clear up to 32767 characters in the buffer until
            the '\n' character is removed
    --> use this to ignore extra input (call after every std::cin call)
