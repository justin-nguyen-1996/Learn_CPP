1. Four Main Input Errors
    --> Meaningless Input (expecting a,b,c but received d)
        (program doesn't handle this case)
    --> Extra Input (expecting one character, but received two chars)
    --> Numerical Value Overflowed (gave a number too large or small)
    --> Mismatched Data (expecting an int, but given a string)
