1. (Non-Const) Global Variables are Evil
    --> any function can change their value
    --> every function call becomes potentially dangerous because the 
        global's value can change without the programmer knowing
    --> say the global's value is wrong
        --> have to look through every instance of when the global was used
        --> for locals, the value can only be changed inside the function
    --> globals can reduce modularity and flexibility
