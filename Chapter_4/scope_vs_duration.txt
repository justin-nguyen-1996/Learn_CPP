1. Scope vs. Duration
    --> scope refers to where the variable is accessible
    --> duration refers to when the variable is created/destroyed

2. Local Variables
    --> block scope (only visible within the block they are declared)
    --> automatic duration (created when entering the block and destroyed when exiting)
    
3. Global Variables
    --> global scope (visible until the end of the file)
    --> static duration (created when the program starts, destroyed when it ends)

4. Global Scope Operator
    --> "::"
    --> use this to explicitly tell the compiler to use the global variable
    --> std::cout << value,    std::cout << ::value
