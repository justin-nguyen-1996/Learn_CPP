1. Types of Casting in C++
    --> C-Style Casts
    --> Static Casts
    --> Dynamic Casts
    --> Const Casts
    --> Reinterpret Casts
    
2. C-Style Casts
    --> double d = (double) a / b; // int a, b
    --> double d = double(a) / b;
    
    --> bad because not checked by compiler at compile-time
    --> allows for mistakes (e.g. removing const or downcasting a data type)

3. Static Casts
    --> float f = static_cast<float>(a) / b; // int a, b
    --> checked at compile-time
