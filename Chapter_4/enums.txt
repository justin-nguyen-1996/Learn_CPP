1. Enum Syntax
    --> each possible value is separated by commas, not semicolons
    --> last value should not have a comma
    --> end the entire enum with a comma

2. Enum Naming Conventions
    --> enum type names start with a capital letter
    --> enum values are in all caps
    --> enum values are prefixed with the enum type name
        --> prevents naming conflicts since enum types are put into the global namespace
        --> good for documentation
    
3. Enum Example
    enum Color {
        COLOR_RED,
        COLOR_BLUE,
        COLOR_GREEN
    };
    
    Color paint {COLOR_RED};
    
4. Enum Values
    --> assigned an integer based on position (starting a 0)
    
5. Can Cast an Integer to a Color (ugly though)
    --> Color color = static_cast<Color>(4);
    
6. Enum Declarations
    --> do not allocate memory until an enum object is created
    --> best to put them in header files and #include them

7. When to use Enums
    --> useful for code documentation and readability purposes when 
        you need to represent a specific, predefined set of states
