1. Extern Example
    --> global.cpp: 
            int y {2};
        main.cpp:
            extern y; // (forward declaration) (tells linker this is defined elsewhere)
            std::cout << y << "\n"; // prints 2, compiles
            
2. Including Constants the Right Way
    --> don't do this:
        constants.h:
            const double pi = 3.14159;
            const double gravity = 9.8;
    --> if constants.h is included multiple times,
        these variables will be defined multiple times
    --> this is a huge memory waste if many variables in constants.h
    
    --> do this:
