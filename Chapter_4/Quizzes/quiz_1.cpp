/*
    In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters. 
    Declare a struct that represents your monster. 
    The monster should have a type that can be one of the following: 
        ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime 
    Use an enum class for this

    Each individual monster should also have a name and healthbar
    Write a function named printMonster() that prints the struct
    Instantiate an ogre and a slime and pass them to printMonster().

    Sample Output:
    This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
    This Slime is named Blurp and has 23 health.
