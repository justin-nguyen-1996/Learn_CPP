1. Default Values in Structs
	--> struct Triangle {
		double length = 1.0;
		double width = 1.0;
	    };

2. Passing Structs
	--> passing structs is pass-by-value
	--> passing struct pointers is pass-by-reference

3. Returning Structs
	--> allows for multiple return values

4. Size of Structs
	--> occupies at least as much space as the
	    sum of all its fields
	--> due to "padding" (rounds 14 bytes to 16 bytes, etc.)

5. Accessing Structs Across Files
	--> struct declarations do not take up any memory
	--> put them in a .h file and #include the file
