1. Scope
    --> where the var/fxn can be accessed
    --> Block Scope (only visible within the block they are declared)
    --> Global Scope (visible anywhere in the file)
        
2. Duration
    --> when the var is created/destroyed
    --> Automatic Duration (created when entering the block and destroyed when exiting)
    --> Static Duration (created when the program starts, destroyed when it ends)
    --> Dynamic Duration (created and destroyed upon the programmer's request)
        
3. Linkage
    --> whether multiple instances of an identifier refer to the same identifier or not
    --> no linkage (identifier refers to itself)
    --> internal linkage (identifier can be accessed anywhere in the file)
    --> external linkage (identifier can be accessed anywhere)

4. Global Scope Operator
    --> "::"
    --> use this to explicitly tell the compiler to use the global variable
    --> std::cout << value,    std::cout << ::value
    
5. Forward Declarations (Function Prototypes)
    --> use this to access a function in another file
    
6. Extern Keyword
    --> use this to access a variable with external linkage in another file
    
Example 	                                                Scope 	        Duration 	        Linkage
Local variable                  int x;                      Block scope 	Automatic duration 	No linkage 	
Static local variable           static int x;               Block scope 	Static duration 	No linkage 	
Dynamic variable 	            int *x = new int; 	        Block scope 	Dynamic duration 	No linkage 	
Function parameter 	            void foo(int x) 	        Block scope 	Automatic duration 	No linkage 	
Non-const global variable 	    int g_x; 	                File scope      Static duration 	External linkage
Static global variable 	        static int g_x; 	        File scope 	    Static duration 	Internal linkage
Const global variable 	        const int g_x(1); 	        File scope 	    Static duration 	Internal linkage 	
Extern const global variable    extern const int g_x(1); 	File scope 	    Static duration 	External linkage
