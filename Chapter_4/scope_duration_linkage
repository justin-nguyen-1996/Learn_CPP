1. Scope
    --> where the var/fxn can be accessed
    --> Block Scope (only visible within the block they are declared)
    --> Global Scope (visible anywhere in the file)
        
2. Duration
    --> when the var is created/destroyed
    --> Automatic Duration (created when entering the block and destroyed when exiting)
    --> Static Duration (created when the program starts, destroyed when it ends)
        
3. Linkage
    --> tells linker where to find var/fxn definitions

4. Global Scope Operator
    --> "::"
    --> use this to explicitly tell the compiler to use the global variable
    --> std::cout << value,    std::cout << ::value
