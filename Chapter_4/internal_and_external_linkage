1. Internal Linkage
    --> can be referenced anywhere in the file, but not outside the file
    --> static globals, static locals

2. External Linkage
    --> can be referenced anywhere in the file and outside the file
    --> extern needed (acts as a forward declaration)
    --> extern only declares the variable is located somewhere else
        (does not actually allocate memory space for it yet)

3. Extern Example
    --> global.cpp: 
            int y {2};
        main.cpp:
            extern y; // (forward declaration) (tells linker this is defined elsewhere)
            std::cout << y << "\n"; // prints 2, compiles
