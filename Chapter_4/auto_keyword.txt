1. Auto Keyword
	--> used for "automatic type deduction"
	--> auto d = 5.0; auto i = 1 + 2;

	--> nice when types get complex and lengthy
	--> Type1<Type2>::Type3 obj = new Type1<Type2>::Type3();
	--> auto obj = new Type1<Type2>::Type3();

	--> can help increase but also decrease readability
	--> only use when the var type is obvious or not important
