1. Build Configurations
        --> a collection of project settings that
            tell the IDE how to build your project
        --> what to name the .exe file,
            where the source files are
            whether to keep/exclude debug info
            how much to optimize the program

2. Debug Configurations
        --> designed to help you debug/develop your program
        --> turns off optimizations and includes debug info
            but is therefore larger and slower

3. Release Configurations
        --> designed to be released to the public
        --> optimized for size and performance, no debug info
