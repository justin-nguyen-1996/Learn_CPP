1. Benefits of functions
	--> code can be re-used
	--> easier to change function than every instance of the change
	--> copying and pasting code is asking for broken code
	--> easier to read and understand 
		(don't need to know how a fxn is implemented to call it)
	--> type checking

2. Downsides of functions
	--> calling them produces significant overhead
		--> need to save the return location
		--> need to perform a branch there and branch back
		--> need to save snapshot of all registers and values
		--> need to create variables for parameters and assign values

3. Why use inline functions
	--> gets the benefit of readable code and no overhead
