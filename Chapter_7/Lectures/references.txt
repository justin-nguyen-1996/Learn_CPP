1. Const References
	--> use const references as parameters when:
		--> you want the compiler to ensure the value won't change
		--> you want to tell the programmer the value won't change
		--> you need to pass const arguments to the function

2. References in general
	--> can return multiple values from a function
	--> copies the reference, not the value --> faster
	--> always initialized so no null values

3. Disadvantages and when not to use
	--> don't use for fundamental variable types (primitives)
	--> can't tell from function call if the variable will change
	--> can't pass literals or expressions
