1. Recursive or Iterative?
    --> iterative functions are almost always more efficient than recursive solutions 
    --> every time you call a function there is some overhead due to pushing and popping stack frames

    --> Sometimes the recursive implementation of a function is so much cleaner and easier to follow 
        that incurring a little extra overhead is more than worth it for the benefit in maintainability,
        particularly if the algorithm doesn't need to recurse too many times to find a solution.

    --> In general, recursion is a good choice when most of the following are true:
        The recursive code is much simpler to implement
        The recursion depth can be limited
        The iterative version of the algorithm requires managing a stack of data
        This isnâ€™t a performance-critical section of code
