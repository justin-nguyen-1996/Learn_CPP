1. Overloading definition
	--> when the functions have the same name but different parameters
	--> different params as in different type or different amounts of params
	--> different return types doesn't count

2. How Function Calls are Matched
	--> tries to find an exact type match
	--> tries type promotion
		--> char to int, float to double, enum to int
	--> tries standard conversion
		--> numerics match numerics, pointers match void pointers
