1. Passing Arrays (all of these are the same)
	--> int fxn (int array[])
	--> int fxn (int array[4])
	--> int fxn (int* array)

2. Array Documentation
	--> put enums inside namespaces
	--> testscores [StudentNames::STAN] = 70;

3. Null Pointers (nullptr)

4. String Functions
	--> std::cin.getline(var, num_chars), strncpy(), etc.

5. Dynamic Memory (new and delete)

6. Dangling pointers (point to deallocated memory)
	--> fix by set to nullptr after delete

7. Memory Leaks
