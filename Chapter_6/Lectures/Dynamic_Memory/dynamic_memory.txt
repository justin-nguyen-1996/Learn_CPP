1. Dynamic Memory Allocation
    --> different from static and automatic memory allocation
    --> need if don't want to:
        --> waste memory
        --> overflow stack and buffer overflows
    
2. New Keyword
    --> int* ptr = new int;
    --> new asks the operating system for an amount of memory
        from the heap and returns the address of this allocated memory
