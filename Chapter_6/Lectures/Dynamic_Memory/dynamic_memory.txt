1. Dynamic Memory Allocation
    --> different from static and automatic memory allocation
    --> need if don't want to:
        --> waste memory
        --> overflow stack and buffer overflows
    
2. New Keyword
    --> int* ptr = new int;
    --> int* ptr = new int {6}; // initializes that memory to 6
    --> new asks the operating system for an amount of memory
        from the heap and returns the address of this allocated memory

3. Delete Keyword
    --> returns the memory to the operating system (but doesn't clear the memory)
    --> using delete on non-dynamically allocated memory can cause bad things
    
4. Dangling Pointers
    --> delete does not remove the pointer
    --> dangling pointer: pointer pointing to deallocated memory
    --> don't delete or dereference dangling pointers
    --> avoid these by setting dangling pointers to nullptr (0)
