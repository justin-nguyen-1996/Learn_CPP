1. Array allocation using dynamic memory
	--> new[] and delete[] instead of new and delete

2. Can't know the size of the dynamically allocated arrays
	--> for each loops don't work

3. Initialize arrays
	--> int* array = new int[5] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	--> int* array = new int[size] (); // all values set to zero
