1. Pointers to Constant Values
    --> only const pointers can point to const variables
    --> const pointers can point to non-const variables too
    	(but still can't change the variable through the pointer
    		since const pointers always treat the variable as const)
    	(but can still change the variable through regular assignment,
    		if the variable itself is not const)
    --> const pointers treat the variable as const, but are not const themselves
    	(const pointers can be redirected to point at other things)
    	(const int* ptr)

    int value = 5;
    const int *ptr = &value; // ptr points to a "const int"
    value = 6; // the value is non-const when accessed through a non-const identifier
	
    int value = 5;
    const int *ptr = &value; // ptr points to a "const int"
    *ptr = 6; // ptr treats its value as const, so changing the value through ptr is not legal

	int value1 = 5;
	const int *ptr = &value1; // ptr points to a const int
	int value2 = 6;
	ptr = &value2; // okay, ptr now points at some other const int
	
2. Constant Pointers
	--> these pointers are constant themselves
	--> int* const ptr;
	--> these pointers will always point at the same variable
		but can be dereferenced (change the variable it points at)
		
	int value = 5;	
	int *const ptr = &value; // ptr will always point to value
	*ptr = 6; // allowed, since ptr points to a non-const int

3. Constant Pointers to Constant Values
	--> these pointers always point at the same variable and
		cannot change the variable's value
		
	int value = 5; int value2 = 6;
	const int *const ptr = &value;
	value = 6; // works
	*ptr = 6; // does not work
	ptr = &value2; // does not work
