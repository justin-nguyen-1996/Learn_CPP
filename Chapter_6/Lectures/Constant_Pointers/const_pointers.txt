1. Constant Pointers
    --> only const pointers can point to const variables
    --> const pointers can point to non-const variables too
    	(but still can't change the variable through the pointer)
    	(since const pointers always treat the variable as const)
    --> const pointers treat the variable as const, but are not const themselves
    	(const pointers can be redirected to point at other things)

    int value = 5;
    const int *ptr = &value; // ptr points to a "const int"
    value = 6; // the value is non-const when accessed through a non-const identifier
	
    int value = 5;
    const int *ptr = &value; // ptr points to a "const int"
    *ptr = 6; // ptr treats its value as const, so changing the value through ptr is not legal
