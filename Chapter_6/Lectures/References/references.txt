1. References
    --> a variable type that acts as an alias to another variable
    --> int x = 5; int& ref = x;
    
    cout << &value; // prints 0012FF7C
    cout << &ref; // prints 0012FF7C
    
2. Can only reference variables of the same type
    --> const int x = 5;
        int& ref = x; // invalid, non-const reference to const object

3. References are Implicity Const
    --> cannot be reassigned (bound to the variable it references)
    
    int value = 5;
    int& ref = value; // valid reference
    int& invalidRef; // invalid, needs to reference something
    
    int value1 = 5;
    int value2 = 6;
    int& ref = value1; // okay, ref is now an alias for value1
    ref = value2; // assigns 6 (the value of value2) to value1 -- does NOT change the reference!
