1. No need to set size
    --> vectors dynamically allocate memory as needed
    
2. Self Cleanup
    --> memory will be deallocated as soon as the variable goes out of scope
    
3. Available Functions
    --> .size(), .at()
    --> std::vector<int> vec = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
        vec.resize(7) // vec = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
        vec.resize(2) // vec = {0, 1}
