1. Subscript Operator
    --> []
    --> int& Intlist::operator[] (const int index) {
            return m_list[index]
        }
    --> lets you easily get AND set members
    --> make sure to return a reference
        --> else the following statement doesn't compile
            list[2] = 3;
                --> say m_list[2] = 6
                --> the code produces 6 = 3 // makes no sense
                --> supposed to be list.m_list[2] = 3
        --> left operand has to be an l-value
