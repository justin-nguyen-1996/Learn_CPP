1. Overloading Typecasting Operators
    --> example:
        operator int() { return m_cents; }
    --> things to note:
        1. There is a space between the word 'operator' and the type we are casting to
        2. Casting operators do not have a return type
        
2. Explicityly Cast
    --> Cents cents(7); int cents = static_cast<int>(cents);
    
3. Implicitly Cast
    --> operator int() { return m_cents; }
        operator Cents() { return Cents(m_dollars * 100); }
        
        void printCents(Cents cents) {
            // cents will be implicitly cast to an int here
            std::cout << cents;
        }
         
        int main() {
            // dollars will be implicitly cast to a Cents here
            Dollars dollars(9);
            printCents(dollars);
        }
