1. Operators are implemented as functions
    --> so we can function overload them as well
    --> this is called "operator overloading"
    
2. What arithmetic actually looks like
    --> int x; int y;
        x = y --> operator+(x, y)

3. Rules for resolving overloaded operators
    --> A) all operands are primitives --> call built-in operator fxn
    --> B) any operands are not primitives
            --> checks for a matching overloaded operator function
            --> if none, tries overloaded typcast conversion
            --> if that fails, throws a compiler error
