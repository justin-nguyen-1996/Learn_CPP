1. Operators are implemented as functions
    --> so we can function overload them as well
    --> this is called "operator overloading"
    
2. What arithmetic actually looks like
    --> int x; int y;
        x = y --> operator+(x, y)

3. Rules for resolving overloaded operators
    --> A) all operands are primitives --> call built-in operator fxn
    --> B) any operands are not primitives
            --> checks for a matching overloaded operator function
            --> if none, tries overloaded typcast conversion
            --> if that fails, throws a compiler error
 
 4. Limitations for operator overloading
    --> A) operators ?, sizeof, ::, ., .*
    --> B) cannot create operators that don't exist
    --> C) at least one of the operands has to be a user-defined type
           (e.g. adding an int and a double does not work)
    --> D) cannot change the number of operands for an operator
