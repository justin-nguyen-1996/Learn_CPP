1. Virtual Destructors
	--> always make destructors virtual if using inheritance

2. Overriding Virtualization
	--> generally not a good idea
	--> if want to call base class's version and its a virtual function,
		just use the scope resolution operator (::)
	--> example:
		Derived derived;
		Base& base = derived;
		base.Base::GetName();
