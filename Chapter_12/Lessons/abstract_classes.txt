1. Pure Virtual Functions (pvf)
	--> also called abstract functions
	--> placeholders that are meant to be redefined in the derived classes
	--> example:
		virtual void fxn() = 0 // set the function "equal" to zero

2. What happens when you use a virtual function
	--> any class with one or more pure virtual 
		functions becomes an abstract base class (abc)
	--> any derived class that does not redefine the pvf
		will also become an abstract base class

3. Abstract Base Classes
	--> cannot be instantiated
	--> if you make an object and try to call a 
		pvf it will have undefined behavior

4. Interface Classes
	--> have no member variables
	--> all of the functions are purely virtual
	--> the class is essentially just a definition with no implementation
	--> create an outline of the functionality desired,
		but leave the implementation up to the derived classes
