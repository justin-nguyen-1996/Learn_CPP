1. Pure Virtual Functions (pvf)
	--> also called abstract functions
	--> placeholders that are meant to be redefined in the derived classes
	--> example:
		virtual void fxn() = 0 // set the function "equal" to zero

2. What happens when you use a virtual function
	--> any class with one or more pure virtual 
		functions becomes an abstract base class (abc)
	--> any derived class that does not redefine the pvf
		will also become an abstract base class
