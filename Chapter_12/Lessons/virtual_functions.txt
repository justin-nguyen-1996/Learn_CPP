1. Pointer with inheritance
	--> can make pointers from derived objects to base class (duh)
	--> but can also make pointers from base class to derived class
		--> but base class can only see itself so unexpected results
		--> more convenient if call the derived version instead
		--> see virtual functions

2. Virtual Functions
    --> special functions that resolve to the most derived 
        version of the function with the same signature
    --> this capability is called polymorphism
	--> example:

		virtual const char* GetName() { return "Base"; }
		virtual const char* GetName() { return "Derived"; }

		Derived cDerived;
	    Base &rBase = cDerived;
	    cout << "rBase is a " << rBase.GetName() << endl;

3. Polymorphic Array
	--> Cat cFred("Fred"), cTyson("Tyson"), cZeke("Zeke");
		Dog cGarbo("Garbo"), cPooky("Pooky"), cTruffle("Truffle");
		 
		Animal *apcAnimals[] 
			= { &cFred, &cGarbo, &cPooky, &cTruffle, &cTyson, &cZeke };
		for (int iii=0; iii < 6; iii++)
			cout << apcAnimals[iii]->GetName() << " says " 
				 << apcAnimals[iii]->Speak() << endl;

4. Protip				 
	--> use the virtual keyword on derived classes even though not needed
	--> good reminder that those functions are virtual functions

5. Static Binding vs. Dynamic Binding
	--> Function calls and variables are translated into machine code
		--> if translation can be determined at compile time
			then it is called static binding
		--> if translation can only be determined at runtime
			then it is called dynamic binding
