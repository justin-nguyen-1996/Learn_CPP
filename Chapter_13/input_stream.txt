1. Manipulators
    --> objects used to modify a stream when applied with 
        the extraction (>>) or insertion (<<) operators
    --> examples:
        --> endl
            --> outputs a newline character and flushes any buffered output
            --> unbuffered output is written immediately
            --> buffered output is written to a buffer and then read out in blocks
        --> setw
            --> can be used to limit the number of input characters read
            --> #include <iomanip.h>
                char buf[10];
                cin >> setw(10) >> buf;
            --> this will read in 9 characters (leaving room for a terminator)

2. Extraction and Whitespace
    --> extraction operator ignores whitespace
    --> can use the get() method to resolve this
        --> char c; cin.get(c); // reads a character from cin into c
        --> char str_buffer[11]; cin.get(c, 11); // reads in 10 chars
    --> characters not read are left in the stream to be read later
    
3. getline() function
    --> works like get() but also reads in newlines
    --> cin.getline(str_buffer, 100)
    --> reads one-hundred characters from cin into str_buffer
    
4. gcount() function
    --> tells you how many characters were just extracted
    
5. String version of getline()
    --> belongs in the std::string library, not iostream
    --> getline(cin, str_buffer)
    --> reads from cin into str_buffer
