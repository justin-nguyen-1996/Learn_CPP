1. Streams
    --> a sequence of characters that can be accessed sequentially
    
2. Input Stream
    --> istream
    --> uses the extraction operator (>>)
        --> when a user presses a key, the value is put into the input stream
        --> the program then extracts this value from the stream to use it

3. Output Stream
    --> ostream
    --> uses the insertion operator (<<)
    
4. Input/Output Stream
    --> iostream
    
5. Manipulators
    --> objects used to modify a stream when applied with 
        the extraction (>>) or insertion (<<) operators
    --> examples:
        --> endl
            --> outputs a newline character and flushes any buffered output
            --> unbuffered output is written immediately
            --> buffered output is written to a buffer and then read out in blocks
        --> setw
            --> can be used to limit the number of input characters read
            --> #include <iomanip.h>
                char buf[10];
                cin >> setw(10) >> buf;
            --> this will read in 9 characters (leaving room for a terminator)

6. Extraction and Whitespace
    --> extraction operator ignores whitespace
    --> can use the get() method to resolve this
        --> char c; cin.get(c); // reads a character from cin into c
        --> char str_buffer[11]; cin.get(c, 11); // reads in 10 chars
    --> characters not read are left in the stream to be read later
    
7. getline() function
    --> works like get() but also reads in newlines
