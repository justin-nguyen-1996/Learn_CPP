1. Streams
    --> a sequence of characters that can be accessed sequentially
    
2. Input Stream
    --> istream
    --> uses the extraction operator (>>)
        --> when a user presses a key, the value is put into the input stream
        --> the program then extracts this value from the stream to use it

3. Output Stream
    --> ostream
    --> uses the insertion operator (<<)
    
4. Input/Output Stream
    --> iostream
    
5. Manipulators
    --> objects used to modify a stream when applied with 
        the extraction (>>) or insertion (<<) operators
    --> examples:
        --> endl
            --> outputs a newline character and flushes any buffered output
            --> unbuffered output is written immediately
            --> buffered output is written to a buffer and then read out in blocks
        --> setw
            --> can be used to limit the number of input characters read
            --> #include <iomanip.h>
                char buf[10];
                cin >> setw(10) >> buf;
            --> this will read in 9 characters (leaving room for a terminator)
