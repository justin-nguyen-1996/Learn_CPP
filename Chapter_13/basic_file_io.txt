1. File Stream
    --> #include <fstream>
    --> ifstream, ofstream, fstream

2. Steps to using a file stream
    --> open the file by instantiating an object of the appropriate file stream
    --> read/write to the stream using the extraction/insertion operators
    --> close the file by calling close() or by
        letting the file I/O object go out of scope (the destructor will close the file)

3. Example

    #include <fstream>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <cstdlib> // for exit()
     
    int main() {
        using namespace std;
        ofstream outf("Sample.dat");
        if (!outf) {
            cerr << "Uh oh, Sample.dat could not be opened for writing!" << endl;
            exit(1);
        }
     
        // We'll write two lines into this file
        outf << "This is line 1" << endl;
        outf << "This is line 2" << endl;
    	
        // When outf goes out of scope, the ofstream
        // destructor will close the file
    }
