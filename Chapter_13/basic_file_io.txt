1. File Stream
    --> #include <fstream>
    --> ifstream, ofstream, fstream

2. Steps to using a file stream
    --> open the file by instantiating an object of the appropriate file stream
    --> read/write to the stream using the extraction/insertion operators
    --> close the file by calling close() or by
        letting the file I/O object go out of scope (the destructor will close the file)
