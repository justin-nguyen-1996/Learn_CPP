1. Streams
    --> a sequence of characters that can be accessed sequentially
    
2. Input Stream
    --> istream
    --> uses the extraction operator (>>)
        --> when a user presses a key, the value is put into the input stream
        --> the program then extracts this value from the stream to use it

3. Output Stream
    --> ostream
    --> uses the insertion operator (<<)
    
4. Input/Output Stream
    --> iostream
