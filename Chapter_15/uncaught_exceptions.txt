1. Try to avoid uncaught exceptions
    --> will immediately terminate your program

2. Catch-All Handlers
    --> catch (...) {} // execution block is often left empty
    --> the elipsis indicates that this
        catch block handles exceptions of all types
    --> put the catch-all handler last in the catch block chain
        --> allows the more specific handlers to execute first
    --> particularly useful when wrapping main()
        int main() {
            try {
                RunGame();
            } catch(...) {
                cerr << "Abnormal termination" << endl;
            }

            SaveState(); // Save user's game
        }
    --> prevents main() from terminating by catching unexpected errors
    --> this allows us to
            1. print the error of our choosing
            2. save the game's state
            3. catch
