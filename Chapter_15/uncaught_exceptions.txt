1. Try to avoid uncaught exceptions
    --> will immediately terminate your program

2. Catch-All Handlers
    --> catch (...) {} // execution block is often left empty
    --> the elipsis indicates that this
        catch block handles exceptions of all types
    --> put the catch-all handler last in the catch block chain
        --> allows the more specific handlers to execute first
