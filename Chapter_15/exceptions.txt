1. Exceptions
    --> provide a mechanism for decoupling error handling from
        your code's normal control flow
    --> allows for more freedom when handling error codes
    
2. Throw keyword
    --> a signal indicating that an exception has occurred
    --> can throw primitives, strings, etc.
    
3. Try keyword
    --> look for any exceptions that occur in this block
    
4. Catch keyword
    --> handles exceptions for a single data type

5. Try and Catch go together
    --> every try block must have at least one catch block attached to it
    
6. How exceptions work (behind the scenes)
    --> 1. an exception is thrown
        2. the program immediately jumps to the nearest enclosing try block
        3. if any catch handlers attached to that 
           try block handle that exception, then that handler executes
        4. else look for the next try block with an appropriate catch handler
        5. repeat until no try blocks left --> program fails with exception error
