1. Exceptions
    --> provide a mechanism for decoupling error handling from
        your code's normal control flow
    --> allows for more freedom when handling error codes
    
2. Try keyword
    --> look for any exceptions that occur in this block
    
3. Throw keyword
    --> a signal indicating that an exception has occurred
    --> can throw primitives, strings, etc.
    
4. Catch keyword
    --> handles exceptions for a single data type

5. Try and Catch go together
    --> every try block must have at least one catch block attached to it
