1. Ordering of the catch blocks with inheritance
    --> can throw classes so inheritance with exceptions makes sense
    --> handlers for derived classes should be put before those of base classes
    --> put the more specific handlers first 
        (same as for catch-all handlers)
    --> otherwise the base class handler will 
        execute instead of the derived class handler
        --> this happens because the compiler checks
            for exceptions sequentially
