1. Container Classes
    --> classes designed to hold/organize
        instances of another class
    --> provide additional benefits (convenience and safety)

2. Types of Containers
    --> value containers
        --> compositions that store copies of the objects they are holding 
            (and thus are responsible for creating and destroying those copies)
    --> reference containers
        --> aggregations that store pointers or references to other objects 
            (and thus are not responsible for creation or destruction of those objects)
