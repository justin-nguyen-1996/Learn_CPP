1. Composition
    --> the process of building complex objects from smaller ones

2. Why is it useful
    --> Each individual class can be kept relatively simple
    --> Each subobject can be self-contained, which makes them reusable. 
    --> The complex class can have the simple subclasses do most of the work, 
        instead focusing on coordinating the data flow between the subclasses.
