1. Aggregation
	--> type of composition where there is no ownership
		between the upper-level class and its subclasses
	--> when the upper-level class is destroyed,
		its subclasses are not affected

2. Difference between aggregation and composition
	--> Composition:
		--> use normal member variables
		--> responsible for creation/destruction of subclasses
	--> Aggregation:
		--> use pointers to objects that live outside of the aggregate class
		--> not responsible for creation/destruction of subclasses
