1. Composition
    --> the process of building complex objects from smaller ones

2. Why is it useful
    --> Each individual class can be kept relatively simple
    --> Each subobject can be self-contained, which makes them reusable. 
    --> The complex class can have the simple subclasses do most of the work, 
        instead focusing on coordinating the data flow between the subclasses. 
        
3. When to use composition
    --> Each class should be built to accomplish a single task. 
        (either storage and manipulation of some kind of data, 
         OR the coordination of subclasses. Not both)
    --> upper level should focus on data flow and coordination b/w subclasses
    --> lower levels should focus on how the the data is manipulated
