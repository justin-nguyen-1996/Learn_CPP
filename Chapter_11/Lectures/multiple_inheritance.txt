1. Multiple Inheritance
    --> a single class can inherit from multiple classes
    --> class Teacher: public Person, public Employee {};
    
2. Problems with multiple inheritance
    --> naming conflicts
        --> class WirelessAdaptor: public USBDevice, public NetworkDevice {};
        --> WirelessAdaptor c54G(5442, 181742); 
            cout << c54G.GetID();
        --> but what if USBDevice and NetworkDevice both have a GetID method?
            --> use explicit call --> cout << c54G.USBDevice::GetID();
        --> can get way out of hand really quickly
    
    -->
