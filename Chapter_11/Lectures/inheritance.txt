1. Inheritance Definition
	--> as opposed to composition where objects have a "has-a" relationship
	--> inheritance involves objects that have a "are-a" relationship

	--> Cars have a wheel, tires, etc.
	--> Apples and bananas are a fruit

2. Inheritance Properties
	--> by default children inherit all of the parent's attributes
	--> but can: 
		--> redefine inherited properties
		--> add new properties
		--> hide some of the inherited properties

3. Why we use inheritance
	--> instead of manually copying & pasting then remodifying the code
	--> we can just inherit the class then add/hide features as needed
	--> instead of redefining everything, just modify what changed
	--> changing the base class will propogate changes to all children
