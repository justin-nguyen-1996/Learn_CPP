1. Inheritance Definition
	--> as opposed to composition where objects have a "has-a" relationship
	--> inheritance involves objects that have a "are-a" relationship

	--> Cars have a wheel, tires, etc.
	--> Apples and bananas are a fruit

2. Inheritance Properties
	--> by default children inherit all of the parent's attributes
	--> but can: 
		--> redefine inherited properties
		--> add new properties
		--> hide some of the inherited properties
