1. Overwrite Inherited Functions
    --> the same as function overloading
    --> redefining a function in the derived class overwrites
        the function's access specifications
        
2. Add Functionality
    --> what if don't want to completely replace base class's
        method but instead want to add to its functionality?
    --> example:
        void Identify() {
            Base::Identify(); // call Base::Identify() first
            cout << "I am a Derived"; // then identify ourselves
        }
