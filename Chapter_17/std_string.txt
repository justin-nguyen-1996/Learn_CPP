1. std::string vs std::wstring
	--> std::string is a standard ascii string (8 bits)
	--> std::wstring is a wide-character string (16 bits)

2. reserve(int new_capacity)
	--> immediately reserve the capacity to be at least this amount
	--> good for when you know that the string will have to be
		reallocated many times (less expensive this way)
