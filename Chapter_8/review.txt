1. Classes
	--> bind together data and functions into objects
	--> members are the elements inside the class
2. Access Specifiers
	--> public vs. private vs. protected
3. Encapsulation
	--> make members private to prevent misuse
4. Getters vs. Setters
	--> used in conjunction with encapsulation
	--> allow for input verification
5. Constructors vs. Destructors (~)
6. Member Initializer Lists
	--> type_here fxn_name(params)
			: mem1(x), mem2(x) { }
