1. Constructors
	--> a special class member function called when
		an object of the class is instantiated
	--> must have same name as the class
	--> must have no return type (not void either)

2. Default Constructors (constructor with no parameters)
	--> called once the object is declared
	--> automatically initializes the object

3. Initialization
	--> 3 methods: copy, direct, uniform initialization
	--> use direct or uniform initialization for classes
		class Fraction {
			Fraction(int a, int b) {}
		};

		Fraction frac {1, 2}

	--> can use copy, direct, or uniform initialization for primitives
		(they all do the same thing in these cases)

		int a = 4; int a(4); int a {4};

	--> copy initialization for classes is not as efficient
		Fraction frac = 7; // calls Fraction(7,1)

		--> compiler tries to convert 7 to a Fraction by calling a constructor
