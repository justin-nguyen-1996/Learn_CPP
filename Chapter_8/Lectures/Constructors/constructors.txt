1. Constructors
	--> a special class member function called when
		an object of the class is instantiated
	--> must have same name as the class
	--> must have no return type (not void either)

2. Default Constructors (constructor with no parameters)
	--> called once the object is declared
	--> automatically initializes the object

3. Initialization
	--> 3 methods: copy, direct, uniform initialization
	--> use direct or uniform initialization for classes
		class Fraction {
			Fraction(int a, int b) {}
		};

		Fraction frac {1, 2}

	--> can use copy, direct, or uniform initialization for primitives
		(they all do the same thing in these cases)

		int a = 4; int a(4); int a {4};

	--> copy initialization for classes is not as efficient
		Fraction frac = 7; // calls Fraction(7,1)

		--> compiler tries to convert 7 to a Fraction by calling a constructor 

4. Simpler Default Constructors
	--> instead of
		Fraction() { numer = 0; denom = 1; }
		Fraction(int numer, int denom) {}

	--> do this
		Fraction(int numer = 0, int denom = 1) {}

5. Member Initializer Lists
	--> class Foo {
			private:
				const int a;
				int b;
			public:
				Foo() : a(1), b(2) {
					
				}
		};

	--> needed for const members since const variables
		need to be initialized upon declaration

	--> also needed for references b/c references are implicitly const

6. Can give member variables default values directly
	--> but still need to make an empty constructor or else compiler error
	--> class TEMP {
			private:
				int a;
				int b;
			public:
				TEMP(){} // needed or else compiler error
		};
		
		int main() {
			TEMP temp;  // looks for a constructor to resolve this
						// just setting default values isn't enough
		}
