1. Intro to classes
    --> Just like a struct declaration, a class declaration does not allocate any memory
        (it only defines what the class looks like)
    --> WARNING: class declations need semicolons at the ending brace (just like a struct declaration)
    --> Use the struct keyword for data-only structures
        Use the class keyword for objects that have both data and functions
