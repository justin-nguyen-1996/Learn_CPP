1. Encapsulation
	--> also called "information hiding"
	--> process of keeping how an object is implemented hidden from the user
	--> allows users to access objects through a public interface
		(this simplifies things and allows all users to use objects)
	--> encapsulation also involves packaging 
		data and functions together into objects
	
2. Can help protect data and prevent misuse
	--> force the user to access members through the public interface
	--> allows us to do error checking/handling before the user 
		corrupts the data and puts the program in an unstable state
