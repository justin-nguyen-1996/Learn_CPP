1. Encapsulation
	--> also called "information hiding"
	--> process of keeping how an object is 
		implemented hidden from the user
	--> allows users to access objects through a public interface
		(this simplifies things and allows all users to use objects)
	--> encapsulation also involves packaging 
		data and functions together into objects
