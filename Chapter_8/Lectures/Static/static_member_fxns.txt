1. Static Member Functions
    --> what happens if you make a static member private?
        --> normally use a public accessor function
        --> but then you'd have to make an instance of the class to use the fxn
        --> make the function static to avoid this
    --> class Somthing {
            private:
                static int m_value;
            public:
                static int getValue() { return m_value; }
        };
