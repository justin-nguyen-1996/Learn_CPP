1. Static Member Variables
    --> static member variables belong to the class and
        are therefore shared by all objects of the class
    --> class Something {
            public:
                int s_value;
        }
        
        Something::s_value = 1;
        Something first; first.s_value += 1;
        Something second; second.s_value += 1;
