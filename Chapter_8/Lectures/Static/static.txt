1. Static Member Variables
    --> static member variables belong to the class and
        are therefore shared by all objects of the class
        
    --> class Something {
            public:
                static int s_value;
        }
        
        int Something::s_value; // THIS LINE IS NEEDED
        
        Something::s_value = 1; // s_value = 1
        Something first; first.s_value += 1; // s_value = 2
        Something second; second.s_value += 1; // s_value = 3
        
    --> exist even if no objects have been created yet

2. Defining Static Member Variables
    --> after declaring a static member, you have to define it
    --> static members do not belong to individual class objects, so you have to
        define the static member outside of the class in the global scope
