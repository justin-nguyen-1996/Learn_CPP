1. This Pointer
    --> a hidden pointer that points the class's object
    --> three implicit steps:
        --> 1. When using an object to call a function, the compiler automatically 
               passes the address of the object to the function
               e.g.  simple.setID(2) --> setID(&simple, 2)
               
        --> 2. The member function is given an extra parameter for this
               e.g.  void setID(Simple* const this, int id)
               
        --> 3. All member variables inside the member function are prefixed with "this"
               e.g.  { this->m_id = id; }
