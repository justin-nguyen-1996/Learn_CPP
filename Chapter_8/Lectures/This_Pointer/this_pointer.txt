1. This Pointer
    --> a hidden pointer that points the class's object
    --> three implicit steps:
        --> 1. When using an object to call a function,
			   the compiler automatically passes the address 
			   of the object to the function

               e.g.  simple.setID(2) --> setID(&simple, 2)
               
        --> 2. The member function is given an extra parameter for this
               e.g.  void setID(Simple* const this, int id)
               
        --> 3. All member variables inside the member 
			   function are prefixed with "this"

               e.g.  { this->m_id = id; }
               
2. Chaining Objects
	--> returning the same object the function was working on

	--> std::cout is an object and "<<" is a member function
		--> std::cout << "Hello, " << userName;
		--> << needs to return a value
		--> if it returns void then (void) << userName
			(which returns an error)
		--> if returns (std::cout) if used correctly
			(std::cout) << username
		--> which is why we only need to use std::cout once and
			call "<<" as many times as why need to output
