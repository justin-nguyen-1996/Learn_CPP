1. Definition of Object Oriented Programming
    --> Objects have two major components
        --> properties
        --> behavior
    --> (OOP) gives us the ability to design an “object”, which ties together 
        both properties and behaviors into a self-contained, reusable package
    --> this allows programs to be written in a more modular fashion, 
        which makes them easier to understand and reuse
    --> objects provide a more intuitive way to work with data by allowing us to 
        define how we interact with the objects, and how they interact with other objects
