1. Const Objects
    --> const objects can only call const member functions

2. Const Member Functions
    --> cannot change any class variables
    --> can only call const member functions
    --> syntax
        /* const comes after parameter list but before function body */
        void fxn() const {}
    --> RULE: make the member function const if it does not
              modify the state of the class object

3. Const References
    --> make the parameter a const reference if it does not change the argument
    --> const references can take literals as arguments but normal references cannot
