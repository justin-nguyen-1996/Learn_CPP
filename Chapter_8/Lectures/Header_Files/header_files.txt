1. Separating declaration and implementation
	--> if you move the definition out of the class definition,
		you have to prepend the functions with the class name
	--> you still keep the function declarations inside the class
	--> but now you define the class using the scope resolutor (::)

2. Getter/Setter definitions are usually still left in
   the class definition b/c they are simple one-liners
