1. Friend Class Syntax
    --> class A {
            private:
                friend class B;
        };

2. Things to note about friend classes
    --> friend B still does not have access to
        the *this pointer of class A
    --> if class A is a friend of class B,
        class B is not necessarily a friend of class A
    --> class A is friend of class B and
        class B is friend of class C then
        class A is NOT necessarily a friend of class C
