1. DOS vs. UNIX
	--> DOS (Windows) uses \r\n
	--> carriage return and line feeds

	--> UNIX uses \n

2. std::endl vs. \n
	--> std::endl 
		--> flushes the output buffer
		--> immediate and forced output to the screen
	--> \n
		--> queues up output and outputs when ready
		--> better for performance
