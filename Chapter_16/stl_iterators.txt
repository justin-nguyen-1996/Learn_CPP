1. Iterators
    --> objects that can traverse a container class without
        knowledge of the container's implementation
    --> best thought of as a pointer to an object in the
        container that has a bunch of overloaded operators and functions

2. Basic member functions associated with iterators
    --> begin() --> returns an iterator pointing to the
                    beginning of the elements in the container
    --> end()   --> returns an iterator pointing to just
                    after the end of the elements in the container
    --> cbegin() and cend() --> same but returns a constant iterator

3. Two types of iterators
	--> container::iterator
	--> container::const_interator

4. Example
	--> #include <vector>
		std::vector<int> vec;
		vector<int>::const_iterator it = vec.begin();
		while (it != vec.end()) {
			cout << *it << " ";
			++it;
		}
	--> extremely easy to use, basically works the same for every container
	--> just note that 'it' is a pointer
