1. Sequence Containers
    --> container classes that maintain the order of inserted elements
    --> the STL currently has 6 sequence containers
        --> std::vector, std::deque, std::array, 
            std::list, std::forward_list, std::basic_string
    --> std::vectors can dynamically grow
    --> std::deque
        --> stands for "double ended queue"
        --> a queue that can grow from both ends
    --> std::list
        --> implemented as a doubly linked list

2. Associative Containers
    --> containers that automatically sort their elements
    
    --> set --> no duplicate elements, elements sorted by value
    --> multiset --> a set where duplicate elements are allowed
    --> map --> a set where each element is a key/value pair
    --> multimap
        --> a map that allows duplicate keys
        --> also called a dictionary
            --> real dictionaries are multimaps
            --> this is because a word can have multiple meanings
