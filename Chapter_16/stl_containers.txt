1. Sequence Containers
    --> container classes that maintain the order of inserted elements
    --> the STL currently has 6 sequence containers
        --> std::vector, std::deque, std::array, 
            std::list, std::forward_list, std::basic_string
    --> std::vectors can dynamically grow
    --> std::deque
        --> stands for "double ended queue"
        --> a queue that can grow from both ends
